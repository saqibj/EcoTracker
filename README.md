# EcoPower Tracker

## Description
EcoPower Tracker is a WordPress plugin designed to track and display the power generated and carbon offset by wind and solar energy projects. It allows users to add, edit, delete, import, and export project data and display the information using shortcodes.

## Features
- **Data Management**:
  - Add, edit, delete project records.
  - Import project data from a CSV file.
  - Export project data to a CSV file.

- **Data Display Options**:
  - Show combined results from the date of activation to the present.
  - Display power generated and carbon offset for individual projects.
  - Option to choose individual projects or subgroups for detailed view.

- **Shortcode Generation**:
  - Shortcodes for displaying various data views: total power generated, total carbon offset, individual project power generated, individual project carbon offset, subgroup project power generated, and subgroup project carbon offset.
  - Include shortcode information in the add/view form, not in the plugin description.
  - Display the list of shortcodes on the main EcoPower Tracker page in the admin area.
  - The output of the shortcode data that is displayed on the webpage should be formattable (meaning text styles can be changed).
